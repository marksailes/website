# Adritian Free Hugo Theme
###### Adritian Hugo Theme for Personal Websites or Professional minimalistic landing pages

See it live at **[adritian-demo.vercel.app](https://https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/)** (simple demo site, vanilla installation) or **[adrianmoreno.info](https://www.adrianmoreno.info)** (my personal site, running on this theme)

This free Hugo theme is a fork of [Raditian Theme](https://github.com/radity/raditian-free-hugo-theme) - a great Hugo theme originally created by [Radity](https://github.com/radity). It's called __Adritian__ because I, the author, am called AdriÃ¡n - and if you shuffle Raditian and AdriÃ¡n letters you get... Adritian ðŸ˜…

It focuses on accessibility, high performance and usability.

The templates are based on Bootstrap (so they're responsive and mobile-first), and the main changes I have made have been upgrades on the web performance and accessibility of the template.

Some of the best applications for the theme are for minimalistic websites, single-page applications, and personal portfolios. It has a contact form you can customize to your mail address without setting up a backend (https://formspree.io).


ðŸš€ Improvements on this version:

- removal of jQuery
- upgrade of Bootstrap from v4 to v5
- Hugo assets pipeline support
- some (basic) i18n features
- added more pages/templates (experience, blog)

- upgrade loading performance (100 score in [Google Page Speed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev))

You can see it live at [www.adrianmoreno.info](https://www.adrianmoreno.info) (my personal website), as well as in this screenshot for reference:

You can see the source code for [my website](https://www.adrianmoreno.info) [in github too](https://github.com/zetxek/adrianmoreno.info), as well as the [demo site for the theme, adritian-demo](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/) ([and its code](https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-demo)) (a simpler version of the website).

## Download

## Installation

#### Install Hugo

To use `adritian-free-hugo-theme` you need to install Hugo by following https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/.

#### Setting up
As a pre-requirement, you will need Hugo set up and running. You can follow [the official guide for it](https://gohugo.io/categories/installation/).

Note: the theme has **not** been migrated to Hugo Modules yet. To install it, you need to set it up by copying the theme files (either as a sub-module or by copying the files). You can follow these [older instructions](https://gohugobrasil.netlify.app/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) or the next ones as help:

- Create a new Hugo site (this will create a new folder): `hugo new site <your website's name>`
- Enter the newly created folder: `cd <your website's name>/`
- Install PostCSS: execute `npm i -D postcss postcss-cli autoprefixer` from the top-level site folder [check [Hugo's official docs](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/postcss/)].
- Clone the adritian-free-hugo-theme: `git clone https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme.git themes/adritian-free-hugo-theme`.
- Replace the `config.toml` file in the project's root directory with themes/adritian-free-hugo-theme/exampleSite/config.toml: `cp themes/adritian-free-hugo-theme/exampleSite/hugo.toml hugo.toml` (*executed from the website root folder*)
- Start Hugo with `hugo server -D`
- ðŸŽ‰ The theme is alive on http://localhost:1313/

The output for the last command will be something like
```
