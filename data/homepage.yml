    If you've come to my website, you're probably interested in either Java or AWS Lambda. More likely still, you're interested in the combination of the two. That has been my area of focus for the last 3 years, working at AWS as a specialist solutions architect. I work with customers, service teams and the open source community to improve the developer experience for Java builders on AWS, especially when using Lambda.

      You explain something about your academic/study background, as well as your
      preferred areas of work. Think of this area as context-setting for the experience
      that you will describe below. Why did you change jobs? What drove you to take a 
      new gig? Even if you are not looking for a job, it's a good way to hint about
      what kind of projects you are interested in.
